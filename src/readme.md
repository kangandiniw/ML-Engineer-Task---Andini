# 5. Practical Implementation Sketch

## High-Level Fine-Tuning Pipeline (Pseudocode with Hugging Face Transformers + QLoRA)
To demonstrate understanding of the fine-tuning process for generating structured, task-oriented instructions, we present a high-level technical design using the Hugging Face Transformers library in conjunction with PEFT (QLoRA).

The fine-tuning pipeline consists of the following stages:
1. Model Loading & Preparation
Load the base instruction-tuned model (e.g., Mistral-7B-Instruct) in 4-bit precision and prepare it for parameter-efficient fine-tuning using QLoRA.
2. Dataset Preprocessing
Tokenize instruction-output pairs into a consistent prompt-response format suitable for causal language modeling.
3. Trainer Setup
Configure the Trainer with appropriate training arguments, loss tracking, and evaluation setup.
4. Fine-Tuning Execution
Train the model on a structured dataset of user prompts and multi-step task instructions.


## Task-Oriented Integration (Functional Design)

1. Once the model is fine-tuned, it can be deployed for structured instruction generation in a user-facing application such as a helpdesk chatbot or mobile assistant.

2. Workflow Integration Use Case
Example Input Prompt:
“How do I reset my password in the Bukalapak mobile app?”

Expected Structured Output:
1. Open the Bukalapak mobile app.
2. Tap on the “Login” button.
3. Click on the “Forgot Password” link.
4. Enter your registered email address.
5. Tap on “Submit” to request a reset link.
6. Check your email inbox for the reset link.
7. Click on the link and follow the instructions to set a new password.
