# 5. Practical Implementation Sketch
To demonstrate understanding of the fine-tuning process for generating structured, task-oriented instructions, we present a high-level technical design using the Hugging Face Transformers library in conjunction with PEFT (QLoRA).

ðŸ“Œ High-Level Pipeline Overview
The fine-tuning pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. Model Loading & Preparation
Load the base instruction-tuned model (e.g., Mistral-7B-Instruct) in 4-bit precision and prepare it for parameter-efficient fine-tuning using QLoRA.

2. Dataset Preprocessing
Tokenize instruction-output pairs into a consistent prompt-response format suitable for causal language modeling.

3. Trainer Setup
Configure the Trainer with appropriate training arguments, loss tracking, and evaluation setup.

4. Fine-Tuning Execution
Train the model on a structured dataset of user prompts and multi-step task instructions.
