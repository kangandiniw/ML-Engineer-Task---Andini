# 5. Practical Implementation Sketch

## High-Level Fine-Tuning Pipeline (Pseudocode with Hugging Face Transformers + QLoRA)
To demonstrate understanding of the fine-tuning process for generating structured, task-oriented instructions, we present a high-level technical design using the Hugging Face Transformers library in conjunction with PEFT (QLoRA).

The fine-tuning pipeline consists of the following stages:
1. Model Loading & Preparation
Load the base instruction-tuned model (e.g., Mistral-7B-Instruct) in 4-bit precision and prepare it for parameter-efficient fine-tuning using QLoRA.
2. Dataset Preprocessing
Tokenize instruction-output pairs into a consistent prompt-response format suitable for causal language modeling.
3. Trainer Setup
Configure the Trainer with appropriate training arguments, loss tracking, and evaluation setup.
4. Fine-Tuning Execution
Train the model on a structured dataset of user prompts and multi-step task instructions.


## Task-Oriented Integration (Functional Design)
This function can be integrated into any task-oriented application such as helpdesk systems, support bots, or digital agents:

def generate_structured_instruction(user_prompt: str) -> str:
    formatted_prompt = f"### Instruction:\n{user_prompt}\n\n### Response:\n"
    result = pipe(formatted_prompt, max_new_tokens=200, temperature=0.7)
    return result[0]["generated_text"]
    
🔄 Example Usage:

user_intent = "How can I reset my password in the Shopee mobile app?"
print(generate_structured_instruction(user_intent))

✅ Expected Output:

1. Open the Shopee app on your device.  
2. Go to the login screen.  
3. Tap on the “Forgot Password” link.  
4. Enter your registered phone number or email.  
5. Tap “Submit” to receive a reset link or code.  
6. Follow the instructions sent to reset your password.  
7. Create and confirm your new password.
